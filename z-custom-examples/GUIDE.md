# Customer Support Ticketing System
## Major Backend Development Project

---

## Problem Statement

Build a comprehensive Customer Support Ticketing System that helps businesses manage customer inquiries efficiently. The system should handle support tickets from multiple communication channels and provide tools for support agents to respond to customers effectively.

**Your Mission**: Create a scalable backend system that can handle customer support operations, from ticket creation to resolution, with real-time collaboration features.

## Core Features

### User Management
Support multiple customer support agents with role-based access. Each agent should have their own login and appropriate permissions within the system.

### Ticket Management
Create, read, update, and delete support tickets. Include ticket status management (Open, In Progress, Pending, Resolved, Closed), priority levels, and assignment to specific agents.

### Email Integration
Convert incoming emails into support tickets automatically. Allow agents to reply to customers directly from the ticket interface, with responses sent as emails to customers.

### Multi-channel Communication
Support various communication channels including email, live chat, and social media platforms. Provide a unified interface for agents to handle all customer interactions.

### Real-time Collaboration
Enable multiple agents to collaborate on tickets in real-time. Include features like typing indicators, live updates, and conflict resolution when multiple agents work on the same ticket.

### Customer Communication
Maintain complete conversation history for each ticket. Allow customers to check ticket status and add follow-up messages through a customer portal.

### Internal Notes and Comments
Provide a system for agents to add internal notes that are not visible to customers, enabling team collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Knowledge Base
Create and manage a searchable knowledge base where customers can find answers to common questions, reducing the number of support tickets.

### Reporting and Analytics
Generate reports on ticket volume, response times, resolution rates, and agent performance. Provide dashboards with key metrics and trends.

### Search and Filtering
Implement powerful search capabilities across all tickets, with filtering options by status, priority, agent, date range, and custom criteria.

## Technical Challenges

### Real-time Communication and Synchronization
Implement instant delivery of messages and updates across all channels. Multiple agents should be able to collaborate on the same ticket simultaneously without conflicts. Handle WebSocket connections efficiently and ensure data consistency.

### Scalability for High Volume
Design the system to handle thousands of concurrent tickets and users. Optimize database queries, implement proper indexing, and consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

### Data Security and Privacy
Protect sensitive customer information with proper encryption, access controls, and audit logging. Ensure secure API endpoints and prevent unauthorized data access.

### External System Integration
Connect with various external services including email providers, social media APIs, and third-party business applications. Handle different authentication methods and ensure reliable data exchange.

### Advanced Search Implementation
Build fast and flexible search functionality that can handle complex queries across large datasets. Consider full-text search capabilities and advanced filtering options.

### Database Design and Optimization
Design an efficient database schema that supports complex relationships between tickets, users, messages, and attachments while maintaining good performance as data grows.

### File and Attachment Handling
Securely handle file uploads and downloads, including email attachments and chat file sharing. Implement proper file validation and storage management.

### Notification System
Create a flexible notification system for email alerts, in-app notifications, and webhook integrations. Handle delivery failures and retry mechanisms.

### API Design and Rate Limiting
Design RESTful APIs with proper error handling, validation, and rate limiting. Ensure APIs are well-documented and easy to integrate with.

### Background Job Processing
Implement background processing for tasks like email sending, data imports, and report generation without blocking the main application.
